# Introduction

**Groan_rs** _(GROmacs ANalysis in RuSt)_, further called just **groan**, is a Rust crate for analyzing Gromacs and other molecular simulations. If you're working with molecular simulations and use Rust, this tool will help you handle various tasks, like reading and writing different file formats, accessing properties of atoms, and performing basic and advanced analyses.

Groan is still in development, so new versions might change how things work. But I hope that it's already useful for many common tasks in analysis of molecular simulations. This book will help you get started with groan and show you how to use its main features.

In the following chapters, you'll find tutorials to guide you through the basics. These tutorials will help you learn how to:

- Read and write simulation structure and trajectory files.
- Access and manipulate atom properties.
- Perform simple geometric and structural analyses.

By following these tutorials, you'll get comfortable with using groan for your projects. The goal is to help you understand the basics and give you the tools you need to explore more on your own.

The hope is that this book makes it easier for you to start using groan. Let's get started!
